A incomplete ls command (core utils on bash) implementation on zig; to install, make sure you have >=zig-0.12 installed and simply run (inside the src directory) 
>> zig-build exe lz.zig
and possibly add to your path as lz;

*IMPORTANT*: this is only experimental/educational and not meant to be used as a list functionality since it laks pretty much all usefull functionalities of such tool and has not been tested;
